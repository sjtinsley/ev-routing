## Project Goal
Demonstrate our learning over the past 10-12 weeks, while having fun and getting to grips with APIs.

## Project Idea
To improve journeys made in electric vehicles by making better use of the stop time. The tool will provide the time -optimal route with charging stops, and allow users to see the places of interest around the stop & other nearby chargers. They can then re-route via a different charger so they can stop in a place they would like to be.

## Tech Stack
MongoDB, Koa, React, Node.JS. Here EV Routing API, Mapbox, National Chargepoint Registry API, Google Places API.

## MVP
User will be able to get an optimal route, see chargers on a map, see places of interest around any charger and re-route via a different waypoint.

## Further Features - To Be Prioritised
Showing the area where users won't have to make an extra stop to visit. Filtering chargers by amenities. Pulling in car info from vehicle reg to show only eligible chargers & get ranges. Allow user to customise battery % to run to. Save route to email.
